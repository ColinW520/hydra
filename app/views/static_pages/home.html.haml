            Twilio is a cloud communications platform as a service company that allows software developers to programmatically make and receive phone calls and send and receive text messages using its web service APIs.
            TextMy.team uses the Twilio Connectâ„¢ platform to help you leverage Twilio's amazing capabilities, as well as its cost effective pay-as-you-go pricing,
            %em
              %strong.text-info without having to write any code yourself.
          %p
            What makes TextMy.team different from most text messaging service providers is that because you connect
            %strong your own Twilio account,
            you pay
            %em cost
            for whatever your usage is. Instead of paying us a ridiculous per-message upcharge, you simply pay a low monthly fee to make it easy to send & receive messages, configure your line settings, and manage your contacts.

          %p One single list to manage. Contacts are easily filtered using tags, sorted by any attribute, and kept up to date with quickforms.
          %p The contact directory is your launching point for messages. Once you've selected your contacts, you simply either message everyone who matches the filter (message all), or just the contacts you selected (message selected). It's that easy.
