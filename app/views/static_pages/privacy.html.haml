%h4 8. Links to Other Websites
%p The Website may contain links to third party websites, whose information practices may be different than Text My Team’s. Visitors should consult such third-party sites’ privacy notices as Text My Team does not have any control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. Text My Team does not make any representations or warranties as to the security of any information (including, without limitation, credit card and other personal information) you might be requested to give any third party.
These links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by Text My Team of the contents on such third-party websites. Text My Team cannot ensure that you will be satisfied with any products or services that you purchase from a third-party site that links to or from the Website, since these sites are owned and operated by independent retailers.
Text My Team is not responsible for the content of linked third-party sites and does not make any representations regarding the content or accuracy of materials on such third-party sites. Text My Team has not taken any steps to confirm the accuracy or reliability of any of the information contained in such third-party sites.

%h4 9. Data Security Policy
%p The importance of security for all personally-identifiable information associated with visitors to the Website—as well as Text My Team customer information, such as cell phone numbers, texts, messages, credit card information, and addresses, and other account data—is of utmost concern to Text My Team, and we have implemented, and periodically review, certain physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help prevent unauthorized access and maintain data security. Your payment and personal information is always safe. Our Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address. Unfortunately, due to the open nature of Internet communications, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure, and thus we cannot guarantee that communications between you and Text My Team will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. Visitors of the Website and Text My Team customers use the Website at their own risk.
%br
%h4 10. Your Acceptance of These Terms
%p By accessing the Website, you signify your assent to the Text My Team Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access the Website. You should visit this page periodically, as we may, from time to time, update this Privacy Policy and such changes shall be effectively immediately upon posting on the Website and without further notice to you. Your continued access to the Website following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy shall be deemed an acceptance of such changes by you. Text My Team will, however, use personally-identifiable information only in accordance with the version of the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected.
%br
%h4 11. Changes in This Privacy Policy
%p We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective.
