%br%br%h1.text-center Terms of Service%br%h4 1. Overview%p Welcome to the family of sites provided by Atlas Does LLC. (“Atlas Does”). This agreement applies to all of the websites on which it is posted including atlasdoes.com and textmy.team (collectively the “Atlas Does Sites”). Use and access to the Atlas Does Sites (including any rebranded or white label version of the Atlas Does Sites), and the common carrier services described below (the “Services”), are subject to these terms and conditions of use (the “Terms”) as well as our Privacy Policy.We reserve the right to change these Terms from time to time. Any updates to these Terms shall be posted on this website. You acknowledge your responsibility to review these Terms from time to time and to be aware of any such changes. By continuing to use any of the Atlas Does Sites or Services after we post any such changes, you accept these Terms, as modified.

IF YOU DO NOT INTEND ON USING THE SERVICES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE TERMS, DO NOT UTILIZE THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY ATLAS DOES.%br%h4 2. The ServicesServices described on the Atlas Does Sites may or may not be available in all countries or regions of the world, may be available under different trademarks in different countries and, where applicable, may be approved or cleared by a government regulatory body for sale or use with different indications and restrictions in different countries. You agree to use the Atlas Does Services in accordance with all applicable guidelines as well as all state and federal laws that the Services are subject to.The Services consist of one or more of the following: a web-based interface, access to incoming telephone number or keywords, messaging applications, voice broadcast applications, SMS and MMS gateway access, data encryption, data transmission, data access, data storage and, if applicable, synchronization software, as well as software maintenance and upgrades and customer support, that enable you to send SMS messages, MMS messages to recipients designated by you (collectively, the “Services”). We transmit messages initiated by you or sent to you by others through different routes, and the level of reliability and support for special features varies according to the route. You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all computer hardware, software and communications equipment needed to access and use the Services, and for paying all access charges (e.g., ISP, telecommunications) incurred while using the Services.Atlas Does only provides that the Services are processed correctly and further transmitted by Atlas Does to the applicable downstream network. Atlas Does is not responsible for the final delivery of any communication initiated by you through the Services, as this is out of our control and is the responsibility of downstream communications carriers.Atlas Does transmits and receives voice, SMS, and MMS messages via other major telecommunications companies and mobile network operators, and thus Atlas Does’ influence over the timing of the transmission of your messages is within the technical constraints imposed upon Atlas Does. While Atlas Does shall use commercially reasonable efforts to transmit your messages and broadcasts to the applicable network for final delivery to your designated recipients as fast as possible, we cannot commit to, and do not guarantee, a specific maximum delivery time. Such times depend on various network and system-related factors among the various entities involved in the transmission of your messages across the public switched telephone network and/or Internet. You should know that communications carriers assign messages with a default lifetime and any message that cannot be delivered successfully within the lifetime assigned to it will be discarded by the communications carrier without any notice. Atlas Does is not liable for any loss incurred by the failure of a message to be delivered, and you acknowledge that damages for financial or other loss resulting from delivery failure cannot be claimed from Atlas Does for any such non-deliveries. Furthermore, you agree that message contents are deemed to have zero value.%br%h4 3.
